##  Sentiment Analysis using Machine learning techniques
![  ](Customer-Emotion.jpg)
The aim of this project is to experiment with 
different machine learning approaches to classify dataset of 
IMDb movie reviews to perform sentiment analysis. Three 
different classifiers are used in this study which are: Logistic 
Regression, SVM and Na√Øve Bayes. The purpose of using 
different classifiers is to check for the best performances. The 
dataset includes movie reviews of 50,000 movies from IMDb. To 
improve the performance of our system additional features 
selection techniques, such as stemming, lemmatization, n-gram 
model, tokenization, and removal of stop words are applied. The 
performance of the system was evaluated using different metrics 
such as Final Accuracy, F1 Score, Recall Score and Precision 
Score. The proposed system achieved a maximum of 90% 
accuracy.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is issued by the Stanford 
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. They have collected the 
raw data from the IMDb website. They have provided a set of 
50,000 reviews in total, the 50,000 reviews consist of 25,000 
movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing.The 
dataset provided on their website is divided into two folders 
train and test, which serve as training data and testing data 
respectively.
### Visuslaization of data based on N-grams used.
In this project, three different kinds of N-grams - Unigram, Bigrams, Trigrams have been 
used in the classification to compute accuracies and generate 
different results.
