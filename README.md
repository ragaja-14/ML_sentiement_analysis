# ML_sentiement_analysis
##  Sentiment Analysis using Machine learning techniques
The aim of this project is to experiment with 
different machine learning approaches to classify dataset of 
IMDb movie reviews to perform sentiment analysis. Three 
different classifiers are used in this study which are: Logistic 
Regression, SVM and Na√Øve Bayes. The purpose of using 
different classifiers is to check for the best performances. The 
dataset includes movie reviews of 50,000 movies from IMDb. To 
improve the performance of our system additional features 
selection techniques, such as stemming, lemmatization, n-gram 
model, tokenization, and removal of stop words are applied. The 
performance of the system was evaluated using different metrics 
such as Final Accuracy, F1 Score, Recall Score and Precision 
Score. The proposed system achieved a maximum of 90% 
accuracy.
